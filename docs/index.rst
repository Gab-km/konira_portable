Konira - A Python DSL Testing Framework
=======================================
Konira is a tool that allows you to write minimalistic
descriptions for testing scenarios and unit tests.

It is flexible enough to accommodate Behavioral Driven 
Development as well as traditional Unit Testing. 

It also adds a few neat things to make testing easier.



How does a test case looks like?
------------------------------------

.. highlight:: ruby

::

    describe "a very simple test case for my_module":

        it "has a foo property that is False":
            assert my_module.foo == False


But this is not valid Python!
---------------------------------

I hear you. It is a DSL. All tests need to specify the ``konira`` encoding
at the top and they can be executed with the included command line tool.

::

    # coding: konira



fast and readable action in the terminal
--------------------------------------------
Most tests take a mere 0.0007s to run!

.. highlight:: text

::

    $ konira
    
    a very simple test case for my_module
        It has a foo property that is True
    

    All specs passed in 0.000 secs.


Are you sold yet?

testing tool packs.


The name
------------

*Konira* is one of the names of an ancient Inca God. Konira Wirakocha diguised 
as a traveler in rags. A trickster, a prankster. No one knew who he was, and the 
people he passed called him names. Yet as he walked, he created. With a word he 
made the fields and terraced hillsides. Dropping a reed blossom, he made water flow.

This is a DSL, it looks like Python - it mostly is, but it packs simplicity and makes
testing look good and easy.
